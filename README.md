Religion is Universal

## Beliefs
We are all universal machines capable of creating new universal machines.

We run on blood instead of electricity.

Universal super power (USP) controls all the creations.

## Ceremonies
None (as of now)

## Rituals
None (as of now)

## Universal : Name registry
The name (both first name and last name) for Univeral will be generated by computer software to bring uniqueness.

This should be done before getting a birth certificate from state authorities.

## Universal : Enter / Exit 
It is a merit based system.

You are not born into this faith but can gain an entry into it.

Define a right age for entry and a strict criteria (something similar to US visa system).

You can be thrown out of this system similar to exile.

Your name and address details will appear in public registry. 

Your universal id will be linked to passport and social security number.

## Univeral Book of Fath
It is like an oxford dictionary that is revised every year.

The rules and regulation should keep changing but ensure to put the entry limit to x % of world's population (also x% limits on state population, district population, tehsil pupulation, village population).

What is the fun if anybody can join it and become? Look at the limits again.

## Universal Income : through donation
10% of money earned every month should be donated to books of Universal.

## Universal Support
Provide health plan, term plan and annuity pension plan for its members.
