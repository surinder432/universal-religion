# Universal Religion

## Why new religion ?

There is a problem with existing popular religions. Most are not updated on quarter, annual basis.

There is a need of a new religion where beliefs are revised constantly every year.

## Beliefs
We are all universal machines capable of creating new universal machines.

We run on blood instead of electricity.

Universal super power (USP) controls all the creations.

## Ceremonies
None (as of now)

The marriage is called Unified ceremony. X unified Y.

## Rituals

## Universal : Name registry
The name (both first name and last name) for Univeral will be generated by computer software to bring uniqueness.

This should be done before getting a birth certificate from state authorities.

## Universal : Enter / Exit 
It is a merit based system.

You are not born into this faith but can gain an entry into it.

## Univeral Book of Fath
It is like an oxford dictionary that is revised every year.

The rules and regulation should keep changing.

It has to be reperesented by a head at world level, country level, state level, district level, tehsil level, village level, locality level (each pin code). India itself has roughly 20K pin codes.
