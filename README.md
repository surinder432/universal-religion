Religion is Universal

## Beliefs
We are all universal machines capable of creating new universal machines.
Instead of electricity, blood runs into our system.

Universal super power (USP) controls all the creations.

## Ceremonies
None (as of now)

## Rituals
None (as of now)

## Enter / Exit Universal
It is a merit based system. You are not born into this faith but can gain an entry into it.
Define a strict criteria (something similar to US visa system).

You can be thrown out of this system similar to exile.

## Faith Book : Revision
It is like an oxford dictionary that is revised every year.
